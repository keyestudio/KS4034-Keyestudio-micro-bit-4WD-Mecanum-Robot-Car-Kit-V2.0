# Troubleshooting-MAINTENANCE Mode

Recently, many users encounter the issue that Micro:bit board doesn’t

respond when connected to the computer.

If the way you operate is correct, maybe you accidentally press th eset

button and enter the Maintenance mode or lead to lose the firmware due

to misoperation.

Plug in Micro:bit board, the“MAINTENANCE”driver appears. That means

the program can’t be downloaded.
